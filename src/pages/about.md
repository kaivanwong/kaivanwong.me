# About

Hey, let me introduce myself in detail here. My name is <b>Kaivan Wong</b> (it's derived from Cantonese pronunciation). I'm a <b>front-end engineer</b> with perfectionism (it's not always good, so I try to find a balance between perfectionism and realism).

As a software developer and tech industry practitioner, I strive to <b>keep myself focused and constantly learning</b> to cope with a changing world. Now, I often using the JavaScript / TypeScript, Rust, and other tools to develop software. 

Here is a list of my technology stack:

- JavaScript / TypeScript, Rust<i class="text-black/50 dark:text-white/50"><sup>(be studying)</sup></i>, SQL;
- Vue.js, React.js, Nuxt.js, Nest.js, Next.js, Astro<i  class="text-black/50 dark:text-white/50"><sup>(this website is built on it)</sup></i>;
- TailwindCSS, UnoCSS, Less, Sass;
- Vite, Webpack, Eslint, Rollup, ESBuild;

Now, I'm working on an open source project called <a target="_blank"  href="https://stacknax.com">Stack Nax ðŸ’š</a>. It's a modern full-stack development platform for rapidly developing and deploying web applications. I really hope that I can realize the project, and it's an opportunity to help me start my own business.
