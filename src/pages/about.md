# About

Hey, let me introduce myself in detail here. My name is Kaivan Wong (it's derived from Cantonese pronunciation). I'm a front-end engineer with perfectionism (it's not always good, so I try to find a balance between perfectionism and realism).

As a software developer and tech industry practitioner, I strive to keep myself focused and constantly learning to cope with a changing world. Now, I often using the JavaScript / TypeScript, Rust, and other tools to develop software. For example, Vue.js, React.js, Nuxt.js, Next.js, etc.
