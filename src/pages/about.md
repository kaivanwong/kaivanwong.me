# About

Hey, let me introduce myself in detail here. My name is <b>Kaivan Wong</b> (it's derived from Cantonese pronunciation) and I come from Tsingtao, China. I'm a <b>front-end engineer</b> with perfectionism (it's not always good, so I try to find a balance between perfectionism and realism).

As a software developer and tech industry practitioner, I strive to <b>keep myself focused and constantly learning</b> to cope with a changing world. Now, I often using the JavaScript / TypeScript, Rust, and other tools to develop software. 

Here is a list of my technology stack:

- JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, Rust<i class="text-black/75 dark:text-white/70"><sup>(be studying)</sup></i>;
- Vue, React, Nuxt, Next, Nest, Astro<i  class="text-black/75 dark:text-white/70"><sup>(this website is built on it)</sup></i>;
- TailwindCSS, UnoCSS, Sass, Ant Design, Element UI, MUI, etc;
- Vite, Webpack, Eslint, Rollup, ESBuild, Pnpm;

Now, I'm working on an open source project called <a target="_blank"  href="https://stacknax.com">Stack Nax üíö</a>. It's a modern full-stack development platform for rapidly developing and deploying web applications. I really hope that I can realize the project, and it's an opportunity to help me start my own business.

In addition to constantly learning new coding techniques, I'm also learning English and reading technical documents in English. I try to write some English blogs to share my life on this site and social media. You can find me on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kaivanwong">Github</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/kaivanwong">X (Twitter)</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/kaivanwong">LinkedIn</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/hikaivanwong">Instagram</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.zhihu.com/people/kaivanwong">Áü•‰πé</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://space.bilibili.com/190014206">ÂìîÂì©ÂìîÂì© (Live streaming)</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://weibo.com/u/5605059021">ÂæÆÂçö</a>.

Outside of work, I like to participate in some outdoor activities, such as traveling, mountain climbing, football(Bayern Munich fans :D) and so on. I hope I can have the chance to see the world with my eyes instead of through TV or mobile phone.
