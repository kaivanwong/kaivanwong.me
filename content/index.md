# Kaivan Wong

Hi, I am Kaivan Wong, a Front-end Engineer. Focus on Vue, Vite, Nuxt & etc.

This is mine [Eslint Config](https://github.com/kaivanwong/eslint-config), [VS Code Settings](https://github.com/kaivanwong/vscode-settings). This is long-term maintenance that you can apply to your projects. You can find my [projects list](/projects) here, and I hope they will help you.

I really like Elon's saying: "If something is theoretically true and can be done best, then we should strive to achieve it". So I want to try my best to accomplish something.

Right now I'm working on an open source project - [Wings Cloud](https://github.com/wingscloud). This is a Lightweight Web Solution based on JS / TS. Built with [Vuejs](https://vuejs.org), [Nestjs](https://nestjs.com), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com). It's used to solve Front-end Engineers full stack, low cost, rapid development in the admin system and server applications.

The personal website and some repositories was inspired by [Anthony Fu](https://antfu.me/), thanks.
